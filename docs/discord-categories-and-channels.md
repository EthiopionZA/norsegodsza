We have provided a variety of channels for everyone, for specific purposes.

## Announcement Channels

Provides clan, war, and Discord information to keep everyone up to date with recent activities.

## Lobby Channels

Provides the general location for all members to get together and share general discussions.
Post some attack strategy tips.
Say "Hello" to a friend.
Post a picture of "Cat" or "Raccoon".
Or just hit it up with a darn out right funny internet meme!

Got something to say or share? The Lobby is your place :wink: 

## War Room Channels

We have provided 10 War Rooms for the purposes of war.
Each War Room has a text and voice channel, where members can join and assist each other to strategize on how best to attack a particular war target.
Each voice channel in each War Room has a limit of 3 members to which can join the channel.
