[[home]](../README.md)

## Synopsis

These are the attack allocation guideliness to how members will be able to determine which enemy target they are allowed to attack for **Classic Wars** and **Clan War Leagues**.

## Disclaimers

- Please note that the following date, times, and durations are estimations, and are solely dependant on the time to which the clan is matched to an opposing clan. For example: If we started the "War Search" at 20h00 and we only get matched at 20h31, then the time slots will be applied from 20h31.

## Dates and Times

The **War Search** will commence as follows:

- Sunday evening @ 20h00
- Tuesday evening @ 20h00

## Range Modifiers

**Range Modifiers** are the ranges to which members are allowed to target enemy bases when the "Slot 2" time slot is in effect.

- 5 vs 5: 1
- 10 vs 10: 1
- 15 vs 15: 2
- 20 vs 20: 2
- 25 vs 25: 3
- 30 vs 30: 3
- 40 vs 40: 4
- 50 vs 50: 5

## Time Slots

**Time Slots** are the slots allocated for specific events to take place. This is to ensure adequate actions are put in place, and that fair gameplay is applied for all members.

The following lists the time slots:

- Slot 1: 00 - 24 hours
- Slot 2: 24 - 36 hours
- Slot 3: 36 - 42 hours
- Slot 4: 42 - 48 hours

## Time Slot Agendas

The following lists the agenda associated with each time slot:

- Slot 1: War preparation
- Slot 2: Equal opposition targetting
- Slot 3: Range modifier targetting
- Slot 4: Open range targetting

## Time Slot Agenda Explanation

The following explains each time slot and its associated agenda:

- Slot 1 (24 hour range):
  - This is the time range between 0 and 24 hours.
  - This is the time allocated for members to prepare their war base defenses, and request defensive troops.

- Slot 2 (12 hour range):
  - This is the time range between 24 and 36 hours.
  - This is the time allocated for members to target their own equivalent enemy number bases.
    - If you are number #13 on the list, then you are only allowed to target the enemy's number #13.

- Slot 3 (6 hour range):
  - This is the time range between 36 and 42 hours.
  - This is the time allocated for members to be authorized to attack within a **Range Modifier** targetting range.
    - If you are number #13 on the list, within a "25 vs 25" war, then you are authorized to target any of the following list of enemy bases:
      - #11
      - #12
      - [#13]
      - #14
      - #15

- Slot 4 (6 hour range):
  - This is the time range between 42 and 48 hours.
  - This is the time allocated for members to be authorized to attack any enemy base without range targetting constraints.
    - If you are number #13 on the list, then you are authorized to attack any enemy number on the list.

## 2nd Attacks

The above mentioned guidelines are also applied to 2nd attacks within "Classic Wars".

## Attack Result Classifications

Each result from attacking an enemy, has a classification to which can be interpreted by a member when deciding if a particular base needs to be re-attacked or can be left alone. In general, all failed attacked bases should be revisited for clearing (This is considered as **cleaning-up**). Semi-cleared bases, can be left alone if need be.

The following classifies each attack result:

- 0 stars: failed
- 1 star: failed
- 2 stars: semi-cleared
- 3 stars: cleared

## Additional Notes

- Members are expected to ensure all bases within leniant capacities are cleared, or at least semi-cleared.
- In the scenario to which you do not have an ideal base to attack, because all enemy bases to which you would like to attack have been cleared, you are then authorized implicitly to attack any cleared bases of your choice.
