## Summary

**NorseGodsZA** is a **closed** clan group, whereby we would like to manage whom is within the clan. This is to create a controlled environment and close environment among other clan members.

## Invite

If you have a fellow friend, or know someone that would like to join the **NorseGodsZA** family, please request from one of the **Leaders**. Allow us the opportunity to evaluate the individual's profile to assess whether the particular profile will be a decent fit within the clan.

## Disclaimer

Please be advised, that to whom ever you are willing to bring into the clan, will be your sole responsibility. If the newly recruited member is accepted into the clan, and at a later point in time creates unrest within the clan for whatever reason, the [prohibitions](./rules.md) will be applied to the new recruit. The player that proposed the new recruit will be recorded for making a bad decision, but will not be held responsible for another player's behaviour.
