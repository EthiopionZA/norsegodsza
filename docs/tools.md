### War Flag Calling

Please leave a flag of the enemy base to which you would like to claim, as well as the entry within **Clash Caller**.

### War Base Messages

If you have information that can be useful for other clan members, such as XBows being set for ground, please drop a message for someone to read. That message can prove to be useful when planning an attack strategy.

## Clash Caller
