# Request Guidelines

[[home]](../README.md)

## General

- All requests must be respected for the nature for what it is.
- Ensure that the correct "Request Message" is sent for what is intended.
- Donations are in **good-will** and are **NOT** to be expected!
- Do **NOT** use requests as an opportunity to satisfy your "Daily Tasks"!
  - If there is a request that can also satisy your "Daily Task", that is a fortunate bonus, but do not donate troops/spells that were not requested for in the first place.
- If you are satisfied with any troops being donated, please set your request message that stipulates this, such as "Anything please".
- Donating invalid requested troops can lead to [prohibition](./rules.md).

## Disclaimer

- If you make a specific request, please be aware that it may take time for someone to satisfy that request.
  - The more specific a request is, the longer it may take to satisfy.
- Please bear in mind, due to the nature of the size of the clan, and the variety of the member levels, expectation of high level troops will be difficult.
- If in the scenario you donate an incorrect troop/spell, please stipulate within the game chat of this. Mistakes happen, but not informing individuals of this, is devious in its nature, and will **NOT** be tolerated.
- Donating incorrect troops breaks trust between members of the clan, wastes time, and in the worst case scenario, can ruin "War Attacks".
