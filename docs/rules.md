## Disclaimers

- If you foresee that you will **NOT** be able to participate within a war, please set your war preference settings to **I'm out**.
  - If your settings are set to **I'm in**, you will very likely be drafted for war.
- In the event to which you are drafted into war, but unforeseen circumstances befall you, please if possible inform the clan that you will not be able to commit your attack(s).
  - If this happens at regular intervals, then we will be forced to apply prohibition offenses accordingly. There is no harsh feelings towards individuals of these circumstances, yet we need to maintain fairness and consistency within the clan to allow a fair and enjoyable environment for all.
